## Title: Choose mySQL database to faciliate data storage 
### Status: ACCEPTED
### Context: A method of data storage is necessary to fufill the requirements for the assignment. 
* Having used mySQL in previous courses and personal projects, I found mySQL a suitable choice for supporting database capabilities.
* Many of the examples provided by my instructor are using mySQL, thus for the benefit of staying consistent with course material mySQL is a good choice.
### Decision: The change proposed to the current implementation is to add mySQL as a method for data storage.
### Consequences: MySQL is popular, however there may be a more modern tool with additional features that could be used instead. Thus, there is a risk of limitied functionality.
