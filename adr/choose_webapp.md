## Title: Choose PHP Web Application 
### Status: ACCEPTED 
### Context: A web applicaiton is necessary to fufill the requirements for this assigment 
* Having used PHP in previous courses and personal projects, I found it to be a good choice to pair with mySQL
* There is alot of documentation and examples online demonstrating how to interact with mySQL using PHP. 
### Decision: The change proposed to the current implementation is to add the functionality of a PHP web application to display SQL data in a broswer with the help of a webserver (see choose_webserver.md for information concerning the server)
### Consequences: PHP is not the most sophisticated of web applications, it is possible I could be limited by CSS and HTML styling effects.
